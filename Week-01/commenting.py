# This is a comment!
# It has text. None of it will be run.
"""You can make multi-line comments using triple quotations, like this.

This is also called a "docstring." You'll see these later, but basically
they're instructions about what a function or class (also for later) is supposed
to do. Think of them like in-line instructions.
"""

# Comments are good for annotating your code.
"""Don't hesitate to write comments everywhere, especially while you're learning
to program. Make notes about the individual steps you need to take to solve a problem,
remind yourself later what some code does, or explain what the purpose of some code
was to someone else.

Comments are meant to help you understand code no matter who wrote it.
"""

# Comments are also useful for debugging.
"""It's very easy to put a # before any line of code that might be a problem,
so they help a little bit with testing things as well.

Comment out blocks or lines of code to isolate problems in logic or syntax."""
