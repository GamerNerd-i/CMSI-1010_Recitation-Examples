    "    like `calculate_mean`. It's much easier to read that than it would be to\n",
    "    identify the formula for a mean every time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Generalization:** Functions make code reusable. For example, if I write a\n",
    "    `calculate_mean` function, then I can use it whenever I need to, no matter\n",
    "    what inputs I have. Using the formula would require it to change every time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Maintenance:** With a function, all the necessary code is in one place, even\n",
    "    if it's used in multiple places in code. Without functions, if you had to debug\n",
    "    a block you used 5 times, you would need to make the same changes 5 times, rather\n",
