# Git and Command Line

This week marks a significant transition for 1010. Although the labs will stay in Google Colab, the problem sets will now be done in "real" Python, and you'll start using git, GitHub, and the command line directly.

> ***DISCLAIMER***: The purpose of these Markdown files is to explain the basics of using git, GitHub, and the command line, with some added context. **This file will *not* go over the process of installing [git / Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or a text editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) preferred).** Those installations should have been completed in class.

If you don't know where to start, read up about [the command line](Command-Line.md) first, because that is the interface that we will be using to access Git for the rest of the semester. It looks scary, but as long as you remember what commands you need to use and how to navigate files, you won't do anything disastrous.

Once you're familiar with the command line, move on to [Git](Git.md). That notebook assumes that you have at least seen the commands presented in the command line notebook. It will be much more helpful if you're only reviewing commands and not learning them for the first time.
