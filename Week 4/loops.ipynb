You'd try it multiple times and give it a little more power each time *until* you give up, the lever gives, or something breaks (hopefully not the last one).\n",

This is what we mean by an **uncertain condition.** You might also notice that the `while condition:` statement looks a lot like an `if`/`elif` statement. They do the same thing: in both cases, Python checks the `condition`. If it's `True`, then the block underneath gets run.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Each time a loop's block is run, we say that the loop has completed one **iteration.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This will also apply to `for` loops. Additionally, the use of loops itself is also called *iteration*, or. We will say that `for` loops in particular *iterate* over data like lists: more on those next week!\n",
