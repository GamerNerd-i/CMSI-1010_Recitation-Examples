    "> A **list** is a *mutable* data structure that stores multiple data types in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that if a collection is *mutable*, you can change the information inside it. So a list is a group of information stored in a particular order that you can edit at any time. Just like your Amazon list, you can add things to your list, remove things, change the items or how many, and view individual pieces more closely.\n",
