    "You've seen that we use variables to store information. However, the types you've seen up until now have only been able to store one value at a time, and if you know how much data humanity generates every day, \"one value at a time\" isn't very helpful. That's why we have **data structures**.\n",

    "> **Mutability** describes whether or not a data structure can be altered.\n",

    "\n",
    "As an example, strings are *immutable*. You can't actually change a string directly; you can only reassign it or create a new string based on the previous. Mutability is important because we often want to control what data can and cannot change. Most collections are mutable, so when you see someone use an *immutable* collection, you want to be really careful!"
