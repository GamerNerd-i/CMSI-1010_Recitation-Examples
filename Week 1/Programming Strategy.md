# Programming Strategy

Programming can be hard, and that's okay!

## Identify the problem

What's the question asking?

## Come up with an idea/strategy

### Break up the problem into subproblems

### Write down all the steps

## Write the code

## Test it

Testing is the most important part of programming. You *ALWAYS* need to make sure that your solution works -- for as many situations as you can possibly think of. Particularly weird or unconventional situations are called *edge cases*, and these are the ones you really want to check for.

Here are some common edge cases to look for as you move through this course:

* What if you get a negative number instead of a postive one?
* What if you get letters instead of a number? Or a number instead of letters?
* What if you get nothing when you expect something? Or if you get something when you expect nothing?

**Remember: Testing isn't one and done.** It's a process, and it's highly unlikely that you'll ever get all your test cases -- and all your edge cases -- on the first try! Which leads us to the last step...

## Evaluate

### Success

To be blunt, you're usually not going to get this on the first try. If you do... Well, the joke goes that there's DEFINITELY something wrong if you get your code working correctly the first time.

Always make sure to test well. It's worth going back to your tests and checking for edge cases like I mentioned above.

### Fail, and repeat
